// Leetcode 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
/* Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k. The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 can be ignored. 
EXAMPLE:-
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).*/

let arr = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4];
let j = 1;

for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++){
    if(arr[i] != arr[i + 1]){
        arr[j] = arr[i + 1];
        j++;
    }
}

console.log(j); // ans: 5
